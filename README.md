# Advent2021

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/). These are not examples of good code; I'm taking this opportunity to explore various gimmicks, challenges, and other silly shenanigans. Obviously don't read the code if you don't want the challenges spoiled for you, yada yada.

Languages used:
* JavaScript
* C (peppered with UB, no doubt)
* [TVM ASM](https://bithole.dev/tvm/emulator.html)
* Much more to come...
